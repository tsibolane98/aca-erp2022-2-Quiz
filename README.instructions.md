## Problem Statement
For the past cohorts, many candidates have been struggling with some tools that we use at ACA,
like Git & Github. With the latter being at the heart of our workflow, It becomes hard to ship code in a timely manner.

## Problem
Delays in shipping code due to insufficient knowledge on Git & Github

## Solution
Git & Github a fundamental skills to your progress here at ACA. With you possessing this knowledge, together as a team, we will be able 
to achieve our vision of "shipping code". 

## Instructions

**!!Important- Hint Keep a log of all your git commands during project development**

**First fork the repo [https://github.com/africacodeacademy/aca-erp2022-2-Quiz](https://github.com/africacodeacademy/aca-erp2022-2-Quiz)**

You are to individually build a quiz app  with:
- React
- Typescript
- No backend required
- Figure out a way to save the quiz score
- TDD is a bonus, but if you add TDD make sure to update the Circleci config
- You are to work on the forked repo, do not commit to the repo shared here

The quiz app should have at least **50 questions**
Every question should cover a concept that was used in building the app. For example

**Question 1**

*What is the git command that downloads your repository from GitHub to your computer?*  

A. git push

B. git commit

C. git fork

D. git clone

The concept covered by this question must/should be used in the development of the quiz.

At the end of the quiz, provide a summary of each question. i.e what the command was used for, why it was used and where it was used..

## Deployment and Hosting Server
- We are going to use [https://www.heroku.com/](https://www.heroku.com/) as our hosting provider
- Then use [https://www.circleci.com](https://www.circleci.com) as our build server
- For CircleCi accounts and Heroku consult this blog [https://blog.logrocket.com/ci-cd-and-react-create-a-pipeline-using-heroku-and-circleci/](https://blog.logrocket.com/ci-cd-and-react-create-a-pipeline-using-heroku-and-circleci/)
- Note that the CircleCi config is provided in this project repo

### Submission
- Submit the link to one of the leads, share the github repo URL with instructions on how 
to run the app.
- NB: Your README should contain the link to your deployed app on heroku

!!Good Luck, the more the questions the more the points

***Your Quiz might just be used as a benchmark for the coming cohorts***
